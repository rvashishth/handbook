Today I will try to shade some light on a very common technology we all use.  And at times I see people getting confused between the reverse vs forward proxy
And they use the words interchangeablly to confuse other as well :laugh_emoji: 
â€¨As you are here means either you have worked on one of above or you are about to.  Possibly we all use
load balancers, api-gateways in our application development.  Some of the common proxy servers are apache mod, HAProxy, nginx. 
We call these proxy servers but do you know these all are reverse proxy, hmm then there must be forward proxy servers as well.

Today we will try to understand key difference between reverse proxy and forward proxy, and ofcourse few things about proxy. 


What is a proxy 
	- add a diagram 

Why we need it
	explain it a bit 

Reverse Proxy(Incoming) and Forward proxy(outgoing traffic)
	- further extend the above diagram in two parts 
	- explain reverse proxy 
	- forward proxy 

Now we know the basics make sure to use the right keywords in your next technical discussions.
